The relationship between technology and the economy: The economy is not only a container for technology, but also an expression of it. With the introduction of brand new technologies, the structure of the economy is bound to change. The goals and means of the economy will change.

The first step we tried was encryption for real-world transactions.
Initially, the following issues were addressed: account creation and security, Gas Sponsor, community building and commodity organization, facilitating transactions and purchases.
This provides a basic shopping process that is basically equivalent to the current Web2 experience.

This is not enough, not by a long shot.
Is Web3 just a payment method change?

What's the next step in the exploration?

Community sustainability, based on the above modules as a foundation, try to explore the innovative possibilities of DApps in economics. We call it DApp2.0.
A new economic paradigm that seamlessly integrates with the current economic paradigm, yet explores this economic innovation by utilizing crypto's ability to characterize the building of lower transaction costs, more efficient collaborative processes, greater scope of collaboration, and more localized innovation and emergence.
Legitimate, compliant, and orthodox.

Centrality lends itself to building stable models of collaboration, a strength and a limitation.
As we iterate on models of the cognitive world, there is a need for structural diversity to extend our cognition and collaboration.

Try complex economics and AI, and crypto to help explore the digital future of humanity.

Next Actions.
  1. Continue to iterate on the original experience
  2. DApps innovate the economy
  3. a sense of meaning that may be missing in the future

========

创新是过去技术的组合和观念的突破。
形成的新概念，代表了更好的模式。
加密技术一定会推动经济结构和的变革。
技术和经济的关系: 经济不仅是技术的容器，更是技术的表达，随着全新技术的引入，经济结构必然发生变化。经济的目标和手段都会发生变化。

我们尝试的第一步，是加密用于真实世界的交易。
初步解决了下述问题：账户创建和安全，Gas Sponsor，社区构建和商品组织，便利的交易和购买。
提供了基本等同于当下Web2体验的基础购物流程。

这还不够，远远不够。
Web3只是一种支付方式的改变么？

下一步探索的方向是？

社区可持续，基于上述模块为基础，尝试探索DApps在经济学的创新可能。我们称之为DApp2.0.
一种新的经济模式，无缝融合当下经济模式，又利用加密的能力特征，构建更低交易成本，更高效的协作流程，更大范围的协作，更多的局部创新和涌现，来探索这个经济创新。
合法，合规，有正统性。

中心化适合构建稳定的协作模式，是优点也是限制。
当我们认知世界的模型迭代的时候，就需要结构的多元化来扩展我们认知和协作。

尝试复杂经济学和AI, 以及加密的帮助，探索人类数字未来。

下一步Action:
  1.   继续迭代原有体验
  2.   DApps对经济的创新
  3.   未来可能缺少的意义感
